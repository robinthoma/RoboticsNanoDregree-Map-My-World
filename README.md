# Introduction

This project is the SLAM project of the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree. For the project, I applied the Real-Time Appearance Based Mapping (RTAB-Map) in ROS to perform SLAM in a simulated environment. See the writeup for an extended discussion of the theoretical content on SLAM algorithms and specifics of RTAB-Map.
# Concepts and Classes
Concepts explored in this project:

- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
- ROS RTAB-Map package
